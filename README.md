# big-10-covers

This project includes 2 main files: model.py and ui.py
As well as several data files under .xls

Model.py contains all of the model building. We import all of the stats that we wanted into a dataframe using the scikit-learn package. We then used decision trees and furthermore random forest classification to aid us in discovering the most optimal stats to be used in our model. 

We discovered a set of statistics that were optimal for the 2017-18 basketball season, but proved to be not so effective over the 2018-19 season.

The ui.py file is where this is shown. Standing for user interface, ui.py runs the logic that we accrued in our model on the 2018-19 basketball season.
